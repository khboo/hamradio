<span class="blackboldmedium">Note:</span> Although we do require logs to be submitted, we do not thoroughly cross-check them for our special 160 meters sprints. We do look them over to try to catch any possible errors if we have a close finish for first place in any division. Otherwise what you submit stands as your final score, so please check yourself for accuracy before submitting. We will have the same categories and divisions for this sprint as we have for our regular sprints except for the first-time entrant highest score.<br><br>

<span class="blackboldmedium">Entry Deadline:</span><br>
All entries must be RECEIVED before 2400Z on the Sunday following the sprint. So submit as soon as possible, especially regular mail entries.<br><br>
Preferred method of submitting your log and report is our on-line <a href="sprint_submit_log.html">autologger</a>.<br><br>
